Viserys shows Daenerys a dress given to her by Magister Illyrio, who has sheltered the two exiled Targaryens for half a year in the Free City of Pentos. Dany questions Illyrio's motives, but Viserys says that the Magister wants to get in his good graces for when he reclaims his throne. Viserys says that she must impress Khal Drogo, and that she does not want to disappoint him.

Daenerys remembers what she had been told of their flight from the Seven Kingdoms--Rhaegar killed by Robert Baratheon, his heir killed, the King killed by the Kingslayer. They had fled to Dragonstone, where Dany's mother had died giving birth to her. They fled Dragonstone with Ser Willem Darry, who took them to Braavos, where he died years later. Since then they have wandered. Viserys is obsessed with recovering his throne, but Daenerys only wishes her childhood back.
